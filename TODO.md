# PayBadge SVG Display Fix - TODO (Updated for Static Hosting)

## Problem Analysis
- [x] SVG badges not displaying in GitHub README files
- [x] Current static SVG approach has limitations
- [x] GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side code
- [ ] Need static solution that works with GitHub Pages

## Updated Solution Approaches

### Option 1: Client-Side SVG Generation (Recommended)
- [ ] Create JavaScript that generates SVG on the client side
- [ ] Use URL parameters to customize badges
- [ ] Generate SVG as data URL or blob
- [ ] Works entirely in browser without server

### Option 2: Pre-generated Static SVGs
- [ ] Generate common badge variations as static files
- [ ] Use GitHub Actions to auto-generate badges
- [ ] Serve from GitHub Pages directly
- [ ] Limited customization but reliable

### Option 3: External Service Integration
- [ ] Use shields.io or similar service
- [ ] Create custom endpoint on external platform (Vercel, Netlify)
- [ ] Redirect GitHub Pages to external service
- [ ] Full customization with proper server

### Option 4: GitHub Actions + Static Generation
- [ ] Use GitHub Actions to generate SVGs on push
- [ ] Commit generated files back to repo
- [ ] Serve static files from GitHub Pages
- [ ] Automated but requires workflow setup

## Implementation Plan (Client-Side Approach)
- [ ] Create client-side badge generator
- [ ] Update existing HTML to use dynamic generation
- [ ] Test SVG compatibility with README display
- [ ] Ensure proper CORS and security
